This is my C++ Tic Tac Toe final project
If you have any doubt about the legitimacy of my work, I made sure to commit my progress every once in a while.
That way, you can check the progression and see that I indeed worked on this project from scratch.
The patch_notes.txt file will have some of the changes I made in the current commit you're seeing.
Beware, the patch_notes.txt file is updated at every push. Meaning the old changes are erased and instead, the
new ones are included. If you want to see the old changes made, just look at the commit history in Github.
