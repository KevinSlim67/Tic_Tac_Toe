main.cpp :
- Added setValues() : sets important values back to 0, NULL, or false
- Added playAgain() : checks if the player wants to play again

generateMove.cpp :
- fixed bug in generateSmartMove() that made it so the computer didn't generate any move after going through
  all the condition. The bug was fixed by using the generateRandomly() function at the end
