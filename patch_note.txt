General :
- Added "hard" difficulty

generateMove.cpp :
- added generateSmartMove()
- added generateBestFirstMove() : chooses a first move that's one of the following : A1, C1, B2, A3, C3
- added generateFunctionsSequence() : The same functions used in medium difficulty, but the order in which
  they're run is randomized
