updateBoard.cpp :
- Added a printYellow() function
- The X and O marks are colored yellow from now on
- Made a few adjustments so the borders of the board don't move when you add an X or an O

generateMove.cpp :
- Now the user will only see the last move the computer generated as opposed to seeing every move it tried to generate
  until it reached a valid one

main.cpp :
- Replaced every goto with a break;
- Rewrote the win, lose and tie announcements as small functions
- Moved the condition that checks for a tie before the generateMove() function. Since the player always starts first,
  they'll always be the one having the last move. Meaning the program should only check for a tie after the player's turn

variables.h :
- Added the library <Windows.h> in order to create a HANDLE h, which makes it possible to use the
  SetConsoleTextAttribute() function, which makes it possible to color text that'll be written after its usage

checkVictory.cpp :
- Replaced some ints into chars to avoid having to cast into char later on
